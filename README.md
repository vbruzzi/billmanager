This app manages orders coming in and out of a kitchen. You can currently add tables, add independent seats to each table, post and remove each table. 


### How to open

Once you have all the files locally, using Node.js you should navigate to the folder that contains the project and execute it with npm start. It will open in your default browser.

### How to use

On startup, there will be no entries and only a single "add" button in the corner that can be used to open a table. From there, you can add seats to the table, dishes to each seat and then add the table to the table display so that the kitchen can see. If you wish to add more dishes, you can do so by modifying the state in the App.jsx file until the functionality is implemented.
